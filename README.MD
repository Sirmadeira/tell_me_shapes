# CNN Training Project

A simple project focused on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch.

## Overview

This project is designed to strengthen my practical understanding of neural network design, training workflows, and experimentation with custom datasets.

## Key Points

* All data used is self-generated; no external datasets were imported.
* The goal is to refine my end-to-end skills in designing, training, and evaluating AI models.

## Notebook Showcase

The complete project, including experiments, training process, and results, is available in the following notebook:
