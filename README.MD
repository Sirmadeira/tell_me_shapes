# CNN Training Project

A simple project focused on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch.

## Overview
This project is designed to strengthen my practical understanding of neural network design, training workflows, and experimentation with custom datasets.

## Key Points
- All data used is self-generated; no external datasets were imported.
- The goal is to refine my end-to-end skills in designing, training, and evaluating AI models.
